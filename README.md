# OCR-like perturbation of documents

Dealing with Optical Character Readers (OCRs) is often time-consuming as ground truths have to be manually labelled. 
I discuss the possibility to replicate the errors made by an OCR scanner on a limited ground truth to a bigger fresh dataset. 

This project was submitted as final assignment for the Information Retrieval class, MsC in Data Science and Economics, University of Milan.
